# House Price Prediction using XGBoost

A complete machine learning project to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques, including XGBoost and data preprocessing.

---

##  Overview

-  **Goal:** Predict house prices based on features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.
-  **Model Used:** XGBoost Regressor
-  **Dataset:** Cleaned housing dataset
-  **Performance:**
  - RÂ² Score: **0.58**
  - RMSE: **883,429.03**

---

##  Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Removed outliers (Top 5% of price, area)
- Created new feature: `area_per_room`
- Converted categorical columns with `pd.get_dummies()`
- Applied log transformation on the target variable for normalization

---

##  Model Training

Model: `XGBRegressor`  
Hyperparameters:
```python
XGBRegressor(
  n_estimators=500,
  learning_rate=0.05,
  max_depth=4,
  subsample=0.8,
  colsample_bytree=0.8,
  early_stopping_rounds=10,
  random_state=42
)
